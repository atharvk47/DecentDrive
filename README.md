# Decentralized File System

A decentralized file system and storage infrastructure are vital for enhancing data security, reliability, and accessibility. By distributing data across a network of nodes rather than relying on a centralized server, the risk of single points of failure and unauthorized access is significantly reduced. This decentralized approach ensures data integrity, facilitates efficient sharing, and promotes resilience, making it an essential foundation for building robust and censorship-resistant systems in the digital era.

##  About:

This project is about a creation of a decentralized file system and storage using blockchain to overcome the drawbacks of traditional file system. In our project, one can upload files on our website which gets stored on a web3 cloud platform, Pinata, and the uploader can restrict or allow the access to that file or directory to anyone.
